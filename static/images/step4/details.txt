PROMPT
TASK: NAVIGATE TO THE NEAREST TOILET, and get as close to it as possible. Use your prior knowledge about where items are typically located within a home. There are 2 red arrows superimposed onto your observation, which represent potential actions. These are labeled with a number in a white circle, which represent the location you would move to if you took that action. NOTE: choose action 0 if you want to TURN AROUND or DONT SEE ANY GOOD ACTIONS. First, tell me what you see in your sensor observation, and if you have any leads on finding the TOILET. Second, tell me which general direction you should go in. Lastly, explain which action acheives that best, and return it as {'action': <action_key>}. Note you CANNOT GO THROUGH CLOSED DOORS, and you DO NOT NEED TO GO UP OR DOWN STAIRS

RESPONSE
I see a hallway with a closed door on the left and an open doorway on the right. The doorway on the right leads to another hallway, and the hallway on the right is the only possible way to go. I see a closed door at the end of the hallway. Based on my knowledge of typical home layouts, the toilet is likely behind the closed door at the end of the hallway. I should go forward, which can be achieved by taking action 2. 

{'action': 2} 


STOPPING RESPONSE
{'done': 0} The image shows a hallway with doors on both sides. There is no toilet visible in the image.
